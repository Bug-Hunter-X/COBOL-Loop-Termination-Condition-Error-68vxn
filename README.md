This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL loops. The provided COBOL code snippet contains an error in its loop termination condition. The loop is designed to iterate 10 times, but the condition used might not always produce the expected results.  The solution shows how to correct the condition to achieve the intended behavior. The files `bug.cob` and `bugSolution.cob` contain the erroneous and corrected code respectively.
